							<h1 class="major">Natural Images</h1>
							<p>Computer Vision is an area with a significant research community that has developed domain-specific SSL algorithms including SimCLR and ViewMaker. Therefore, natural images are a starting point for developing domain-agnostic methods.</p>

								<h4>ImageNet</h4>
								<p>The <a href="http://image-net.org/">ImageNet</a> dataset contains images organized according to the WordNet hierarchy. Concepts in WordNet, described by multiple words or word phrases, are known as synonym sets or “synsets.” While the ultimate goal is to provide 1000 images for each of the 100,000 synsets in WordNet, the present ImageNet test split (2012, with a minor 2019 patch) contains about 100,000 images. This dataset is used for image classification and must be manually downloaded.</p>

								<h4>Describable Textures Dataset</h4>
								<p>The <a href=”https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/dtd/index.html”>Describable Textures Database</a> contains 5640 images organized according to a list of 47 categories related to human perception of textures. The capabilities of the human visual system go beyond object recognition to include a rich understanding of visual impressions of texture (e.g. irregular, sparse, line-like, polka-dotted). This database was created with the goal of reproducing this capability in machines. The database includes images taken from Google and Flickr where at least 90% of the surface contains a certain category attribute. There are 120 images for each category, ranging in size from 300x300 to 640x640. The key attribute (main category) and a list of joint attributes are provided for each image. </p>

							<div class="dataset">
								<h4>FGVC-Aircraft </h4>
								<p>The <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/fgvc-aircraft/">FGVC-Aircraft</a> database is comprised of 10,000 images of aircraft. A four-level hierarchy is used to categorize the aircraft images, from model (not used in evaluation as some models are visually indistinguishable), to variant class (visually indistinguishable models are grouped into one of 100 variant classes), to family (70 families) to manufacturer (41 manufacturers). These images are organized into training images (3334), validation images (3333), and testing images (3333). The dataset is available as csv files with three columns: image file name, variant class name, and categorical value for the class (0-99).</p>

							<div class="dataset">
								<h4>Caltech-UCSD Birds</h4>
								<p>The <a href=”http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200.html”>Caltech-UCSD Birds</a> database consists of images of 200, mostly North American, bird species. The 2010 dataset contains 6033 images, while the 2011 dataset has 11,788 images. Bounding boxes and segmentation labels are included in annotations.</p>

								<h4>German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark</h4>
								<p>The <a href=”https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign/download” >German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark</a> database contains over 50,000 images of traffic signs in more than 40 classes. Images vary in illumination and contain rich backgrounds. The database was created for a single image, multiclass classification challenge. For each image the 5 column csv file contains the path to the image, image class ID, shape of sign, color of sign, and sign ID per Ukrainian traffic rule. </p>

								<h4>Oxford_Flowers102</h4>
								<p>The <a href=”https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/” >Oxford_Flowers102</a> dataset consists of images of flowers from 102 classes commonly occurring in the United Kingdom. The images are varied in scale, pose, and light. Each class contains between 40 and 258 images. The dataset is divided into training and validation sets with 10 images per class (1020 images total each). The remaining 6149 images comprise a test set with a minimum of 20 images per class. </p>
